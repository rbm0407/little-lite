# Little Lite MVC Example
A simple example of MVC application written in pure PHP.

Thanks to perikson developer who wrote the example that inspired me to develop this small application MVC. The Perikzzon wrote this example the following repository: http://code.runnable.com/VDmWiT3TzycRcN6N/php-mvc-simple-for-template

It is always good to code for fun.
