# Little Lite MVC Example
A simple example of MVC application written in pure PHP.

Thanks to perikson developer who wrote the example that inspired me to develop this small application MVC. The Perikzzon wrote this example the following repository: http://code.runnable.com/VDmWiT3TzycRcN6N/php-mvc-simple-for-template

It is always good to code for fun!

## Instructions
This application does not use database.
The sample data is retrieved from a sample json file provided by [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The layout model used in this example was removed from the site [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
The model used was the [Modern Business](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/).

The sample images were taken from the [Loren Flicker](http://loremflickr.com).
